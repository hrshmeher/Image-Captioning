Implementing an image captioning system involves combining computer vision techniques with natural language processing. Here's an example of image captioning code using the popular deep learning library, TensorFlow, and the Flickr8k dataset. Implementing image captioning is a complex task that requires training a deep learning model on a large dataset



# TO RUN THIS CODE 
you'll need the following:

Pre-trained InceptionV3 model weights (imagenet version).
A pre-trained captioning model (caption_model.h5).
Word-to-index and index-to-word mappings saved as numpy files (word_to_index.npy and index_to_word.npy).
A tokenizer used to tokenize the captions saved as a JSON file (tokenizer.json).
An example image (example.jpg) for caption generation.
